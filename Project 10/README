# Fraud Detection Using Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using anomaly detection techniques. By leveraging machine learning models and statistical analysis, we aim to identify unusual patterns in financial transactions that indicate fraudulent activities.

## Objectives
- Develop an anomaly detection model for fraud detection.
- Identify key indicators of fraudulent transactions.
- Utilize machine learning techniques for unsupervised and supervised fraud detection.
- Visualize fraud trends and patterns in financial data.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / Financial Institutions / Synthetic Data
- **Features:**
  - Transaction ID
  - Timestamp
  - Amount
  - Merchant Category
  - User Location
  - Payment Method
  - Transaction Status
  - Historical Fraud Flag

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing values and inconsistencies
   - Feature engineering for anomaly detection
   - Normalization and standardization

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis of transaction amounts
   - Correlation heatmaps of key features
   - Identifying outliers using statistical methods

3. **Anomaly Detection Techniques**
   - **Statistical Methods:** Z-score, IQR-based detection
   - **Machine Learning:**
     - Isolation Forest
     - One-Class SVM
     - Autoencoders
     - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
   - **Deep Learning:** LSTM for sequential fraud pattern detection

4. **Model Evaluation & Visualization**
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-score for model performance
   - ROC-AUC curve analysis
   - Fraud trend visualization using interactive dashboards

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau / Power BI
- SQL for data querying

## Results & Insights
- Identified key transaction attributes influencing fraud detection.
- Implemented effective anomaly detection models with high accuracy.
- Developed interactive fraud detection dashboards for monitoring.
