Fraud detection has become a critical concern for businesses in various sectors. With the rise of digital transactions, fraudsters have found new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in online systems. This paper explores the application of anomaly detection techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset. By analyzing transactional patterns and using machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent activities. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the problem, methods used, and results obtained, along with ethical considerations and future recommendations for the application of anomaly detection in fraud detection systems.

Business Problem
Fraudulent activities, particularly in financial transactions, can lead to significant monetary losses, damage to reputation, and legal repercussions. As digital platforms expand, the volume of transactions has increased, making it difficult to manually review and detect fraudulent behaviors. The ability to automatically detect and prevent fraud is therefore essential for organizations that deal with high-value transactions. Identifying fraud using traditional rule-based systems is often inadequate due to the evolving nature of fraudulent tactics. Hence, the need for innovative approaches, such as anomaly detection, has emerged as a viable solution for identifying outliers and detecting potential fraudulent transactions in real-time.
