# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms

## Overview
Customer segmentation is a fundamental aspect of marketing analytics, helping businesses better understand their customer base and improve personalized marketing strategies. By grouping customers with similar characteristics, businesses can target specific customer segments more effectively, thereby improving customer retention and sales.

This project applies clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to segment customers based on their data. The goal is to provide insights into the effectiveness of these methods for different types of customer segmentation.

## Business Problem
Businesses often struggle to identify and target the right customer segments due to the vast and diverse nature of their customer base. Effective segmentation enables:
- Tailored marketing campaigns
- Improved customer engagement
- Higher customer retention rates
- Better product recommendations
- Increased sales and profitability

By leveraging clustering techniques, businesses can automatically identify meaningful customer groups based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and other key attributes.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / Company CRM Data
- **Features:**
  - Customer ID
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Annual Income
  - Spending Score
  - Purchase Frequency
  - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
  - Product Preferences

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and inconsistencies
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Outlier detection and removal

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding distributions of key customer attributes
   - Identifying relationships and correlations
   - Visualizing customer spending patterns

3. **Clustering Algorithms**
   - **K-Means Clustering:** Identifying customer segments based on similarity
   - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Building a tree-like structure for segmentation
   - **DBSCAN:** Discovering density-based customer clusters

4. **Model Evaluation & Visualization**
   - Elbow method & Silhouette Score for optimal K-Means clusters
   - Dendrogram analysis for Hierarchical Clustering
   - 2D/3D visualizations of customer segments

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau / Power BI (for dashboard visualizations)

## Results & Insights
- Identified distinct customer segments with unique purchasing behaviors.
- Provided recommendations on personalized marketing strategies for each segment.
- Visualized customer clusters to help businesses make data-driven decisions.
