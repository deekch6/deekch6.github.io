Customer segmentation is a fundamental aspect of marketing analytics, helping businesses better understand their customer base and improve personalized marketing strategies. By grouping customers with similar characteristics, businesses can target specific customer segments more effectively, thereby improving customer retention and sales.
Clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, offer powerful tools to automatically segment customers based on their data. This paper demonstrates the application of these clustering methods on a marketing dataset, providing insights into their effectiveness for different types of customer segmentation.

Business Problem
Businesses face the constant challenge of understanding and segmenting their customers to design targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer experiences, and maximize revenue. However, with an ever-increasing volume of customer data, deriving meaningful insights from this data has become a complex task. Traditional segmentation methods often fall short of capturing the diverse and dynamic nature of customer behavior.
This project aims to address these challenges by employing advanced clustering techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to segment customers based on demographic, behavioral, and transactional attributes. By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can:
1.	Personalize marketing efforts to improve conversion rates.
2.	Optimize product recommendations and service offerings.
3.	Predict and reduce customer churn by addressing specific group needs.
The overarching goal of this project is to empower businesses with actionable insights that drive customer-centric decision-making, leading to improved business performance and customer satisfaction.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of different clustering techniques—K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN—on customer segmentation tasks. Each method has its strengths, with K-Means being the most efficient for well-defined spherical clusters, Hierarchical Clustering offering hierarchical insights, and DBSCAN being the best choice for datasets with noise and varying densities.
