Visualizing Cholesterol Levels Across Diverse Populations

# Visualizing Cholesterol Levels Across Diverse Populations

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize cholesterol levels across different demographic groups, exploring trends, risk factors, and correlations with health conditions. By leveraging statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, we provide insights into cholesterol variations across populations.

## Objectives
- Analyze cholesterol level distributions across age, gender, and ethnicity.
- Identify key factors influencing cholesterol levels.
- Visualize trends using interactive charts and dashboards.
- Correlate cholesterol levels with health risks such as heart disease and diabetes.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / Public Health Databases / NHANES
- **Features:**
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Ethnicity
  - Total Cholesterol
  - HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)
  - LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)
  - Triglycerides
  - BMI
  - Blood Pressure
  - Health Conditions (e.g., Diabetes, Heart Disease)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing or inconsistent values
   - Normalization and scaling
   - Categorization of cholesterol levels (low, normal, high)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics of cholesterol levels
   - Box plots, histograms, and violin plots for distribution analysis
   - Correlation heatmaps between cholesterol levels and health indicators

3. **Visualization Techniques**
   - Interactive dashboards using Tableau / Power BI
   - Python-based visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
   - Geographic mapping of cholesterol trends

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau / Power BI
- Statistical Analysis (Scipy, Statsmodels)

## Results & Insights
- Identified demographic patterns in cholesterol levels.
- Highlighted health risks associated with high cholesterol.
- Developed interactive visualizations for trend analysis.
