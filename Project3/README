Statistical Analysis and Pricing Trends in the Used Car Market

# Statistical Analysis and Pricing Trends in the Used Car Market

## Overview
This project explores pricing trends in the used car market using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, we aim to identify key factors influencing car prices and develop predictive models to estimate fair market values.

## Objectives
- Analyze pricing trends in the used car market.
- Identify key factors affecting vehicle prices, such as age, mileage, brand, and condition.
- Develop machine learning models to predict used car prices.
- Provide visual insights through data visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / Used Car Listings / Government Vehicle Registrations
- **Features:**
  - Make & Model
  - Year of Manufacture
  - Mileage
  - Fuel Type
  - Transmission Type
  - Engine Size
  - Location
  - Seller Type
  - Condition Score
  - Market Price

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates)
   - Feature engineering (deriving additional insights from raw data)
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalization and scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics and correlation analysis
   - Visualization of price distributions, mileage trends, and depreciation curves
   - Box plots, histograms, and scatter plots for key variables

3. **Statistical & Machine Learning Models**
   - Multiple Linear Regression
   - Decision Trees and Random Forests
   - Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
   - Clustering analysis to segment price groups

4. **Visualization & Interpretation**
   - Interactive dashboards using Tableau / Power BI
   - Python visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
   
## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau / Power BI
- Kaggle Datasets

## Results & Insights
- Identified significant predictors of used car prices.
- Built regression models with high predictive accuracy.
- Visualized depreciation trends and optimal selling periods.
