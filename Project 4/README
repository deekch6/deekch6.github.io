Amazon Best Sellers A Comprehensive Product and Sales Analysis

# Amazon Best Sellers: A Comprehensive Product and Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Amazon's best-selling products across various categories. By leveraging sales data, customer reviews, and product features, we aim to uncover trends, factors influencing top-selling products, and patterns in customer preferences.

## Objectives
- Identify key trends in Amazon best-selling products.
- Analyze product features that contribute to high sales rankings.
- Examine customer sentiment and review patterns.
- Develop predictive models for sales trends and product success.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / Amazon API / Web Scraping
- **Features:**
  - Product Name
  - Category
  - Price
  - Rating
  - Review Count
  - Sales Rank
  - Brand
  - Number of Variants
  - Discounts and Promotions

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Data extraction via API or web scraping
   - Cleaning and handling missing values
   - Feature engineering (deriving useful attributes)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics and data visualization
   - Sales rank distribution analysis
   - Price vs. rating correlation
   - Review sentiment analysis

3. **Statistical & Machine Learning Models**
   - Regression analysis to predict sales rank
   - Sentiment analysis using NLP (Natural Language Processing)
   - Clustering analysis for product segmentation

4. **Visualization & Interpretation**
   - Interactive dashboards with Tableau/Power BI
   - Python-based visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, NLP with NLTK & SpaCy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau / Power BI
- Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium)

## Results & Insights
- Identified best-selling product attributes.
- Discovered patterns in pricing, ratings, and reviews.
- Built predictive models for sales rank estimation.
