Global Economic Trends: Analyzing Countries by GDP

# Global Economic Trends: Analyzing Countries by GDP

## Overview
This project analyzes global economic trends by examining GDP and related economic indicators across various countries. Using data visualization and machine learning techniques, we explore economic growth patterns, disparities, and potential predictors of GDP variations.

## Objectives
- Understand economic trends by analyzing GDP data across different nations.
- Identify key factors influencing GDP, such as population, trade balance, inflation, and investment.
- Apply data science techniques to uncover patterns and relationships.
- Present insights through visualizations and statistical modeling.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / World Bank / IMF / OECD
- **Features:**
  - Country Name
  - GDP (Current US$)
  - GDP per Capita
  - Inflation Rate
  - Trade Balance (% of GDP)
  - Population Growth Rate
  - Unemployment Rate
  - Investment in Infrastructure

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, outliers)
   - Feature Engineering (creating new meaningful variables)
   - Normalization/Standardization

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics and summary insights
   - Data visualizations (histograms, box plots, correlation matrices, heatmaps)

3. **Statistical Analysis & Modeling**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Regression models to predict GDP
   - Clustering countries based on economic similarities

4. **Visualization & Interpretation**
   - Interactive dashboards using Tableau/Power BI
   - Python visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
   
## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau / Power BI
- Kaggle Datasets

## Results & Insights
- Identified key economic indicators that impact GDP.
- Clustering analysis revealed economic similarities among groups of countries.
- Visualization of GDP growth trends over the years.
